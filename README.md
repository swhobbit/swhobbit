I'm just a [Software Sojourner](https://hobbit.kew.com) (hence my nom de network, which is an abbreviation of **Software Hobbit**).

More formally, I am [Drew Derbyshire](https://hobbit.kew.com/2022/03/i-havent-heard-that-name-in-years.html), a professional software developer.
 
On the side, I am the proprietor of Kendra Electronic Wonderworks, a small software house founded in 1989. It mostly does OSS.
After almost 18 years in Massachusetts, we moved to Kenmore, Washington (north of Seattle) in 2007.

I started in operations, but I have been mostly in development since my misspent youth.

I've made money in (chronological order, **not** level of expertise!)  using `COBOL`, `PL/I`, `IBM Assembler`, `REXX`, `C/C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Perl`, and `JS`.
(Not that I often admit the last two. I also only admit that I know `Go` under duress, because I've never used it professionally.)  

When I next look for work, it will likely be in `C/C++`, `Java`, `Python`, or perhaps `Go`.

I have used more OS families than most people have, including: 
- Many generations of IBM `OS/360` and its successors
- Many generations of IBM `VM/370` and its successors
- IBM `DOS/VSE`
- `MUSIC` (*McGill University System for Interactive Computing*)
- `Singer System Ten`
- Digital Equipment Corporation `TOPS-10`
- Digital Equipment Corporation `VMS`
- TRS-80 `Level I BASIC`
- `CP/M`
- `MS-DOS` from 1.x to the current `FreeDOS`
- `Windows` from 3.0 to present day
- `OS/2` from 1.2 to 4.52
- `MacOS X` and its successors
- Many, many flavors of `UNIX`:
  - Amdahl `UTS`
  - `SCO UNIX` / `Unixware` 
  - `AIX`
  - `SunOS` / `Solaris`
  - `BSD` / `FreeBSD` / `NetBSD`
  - `Linux` (including `RedHat`, `Ubuntu`, `Raspberry Pi OS`, and others) 

I beat the rush to multiprocessor systems in the late 1980s, and I did massively parallel systems in early 1990s. 

I detoured into SRE under the guy who originated it. I've carried a pager enough there and elsewhere that my phone is grafted to me. 

I did OSS (e-mail via dial-up [UUCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP)) before the term existed.
(It was also before dial-up `UUCP` convincingly lost the protocol war to `SMTP`/`POP3`/`IMAP4` over always on connections.)
Its website is still at [UUPC.net](https://uupc.net), and the source is also here on Github at [github.com/swhobbit/UUPC](https://github.com/swhobbit/UUPC).

My [oldest Internet domain](https://domain.kew.com/) is probably older than yours. 

I am the volunteer valet to an [IBM 4361 running VM/SP 5](https://wiki.livingcomputers.org/doku.php#ibm_4300_series), which can be remotely accessed for *free*. 
(**Disclaimer**: I neither work for nor speak for its owners.)
