I'm just a Software Sojourner (hence my nom de network, which is an abbreviation of **software hobbit**).

More formally, I am Drew Derbyhire, a professional software developer.
 
On the side, I am the proprietor of Kendra Electronic Wonderworks, a small software house founded in 1989.
After almost 18 years in Massachusetts, we moved to Kenmore, Washington (north of Seattle) in 2007.

I started in operations, I but have been mostly in development since my misspent youth.

I've made money using `PL/I`, `IBM Assembler`, `REXX`, `C/C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Perl`, & `JS`.
(Not that I often admit the last two. I only admit I admit know `Go` under duress, because I've never used it professionally.)

I beat the rush to multiprocessor systems in the late 1980s, and I did massively parallel systems in early 1990s. 

I detoured into SRE under the guy who originated it. I've carried a pager enough there & elsewhere that my phone is grafted to me. 

I did OSS (e-mail via dial-up [UUCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP)) before the term existed.

My [oldest Internet domain](https://domain.kew.com/) is propably older than yours. 

I have used more OS families than most people have, including: 
- Many generations of `IBM OS/360` and its children
- Many generations of `IBM VM/370` and its children
- `IBM DOS/VSE`
- `CP/M`
- `MS-DOS` from 1.x to the current `FreeDOS`
- `Windows` from 3.0 to present day
- `OS/2` from 1.2 to 4.52
- Many, many flavors of `UNIX`:
  - Amdahl `UTS`
  - `SCO UNIX` / `Unixware` 
  - `AIX`
  - `SunOS` / `Solaris`
  - `BSD` / `FreeBSD` / `NetBSD`
  - `Linux` (including `RedHat`, `Ubuntu`, `Raspberry Pi OS`, and others)
