I am Drew Derbyhire, the proprietor of Kendra Electronic Wonderworks, a small software house founded in 1989.
After almost 18 years in Massachusetts, we moved to Kenmore, Washington (north of Seattle) in 2007.

My [oldest Internet domain](https://domain.kew.com/) is propably older than yours. 

I'm just a Software Sojourner.

I started in operations, but have been mostly in development since my misspent youth.

I worked on multiprocessor systems in the late 1980s, and did massively parallel systems in early 1990s. 

I did OSS before the term existed.

I detoured into SRE under the guy who originated it. I've carried a pager enough there & elsewhere that my phone is grafted to me. 

I've made money using `PL/I`, `IBM Assembler`, `C/C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Perl`, & `JS`.  
(Not that I often often the last two. I will only admit I know `Go` under duress, because I've never made money with it.)

I have used more OS families than most have, including: 
- Many generations of OS/360 and its children
- `IBM DOS/VSE`
- `CP/M`
- `MS-DOS` from 1.x to the current `FreeDOS`
- `Windows` from 3.0 to present day
- `OS/2` from 1.2 to 4.52
- Many, many flavors of `UNIX`:
  - Amdahl `UTS`
  - `SCO UNIX` / `Unixware` 
  - `AIX`
  - `SunOS` / `Solaris`
  - `BSD` / `FreeBSD` / `NetBSD`
  - `Linux` (including `RedHat`, `Ubuntu`, `Raspberry Pi OS`, and others)
